Gomoku two players

The small game I want to make is called Gomoku. It is a very simple chess game. 
The two sides of the chess are black and white. When one of the chess pieces is connected to 5 pieces. win.
This game is a two-player battle game.people use the mouse to play chess.
Human-computer battle is not supported, and they cannot regret chess. 


First , l start to set up the chessboard. I will explain the size, number and location of the chessboard in the comments.


After setting up the chessboard, I will set the color of the chess pieces so that both sides play chess alternately. 


Then set up the winning and losing mechanism to judge the game. 
When there is a side with 5 players in a line, it is a victory, and the game is over when one side wins.
